**Author**: Jason and Timea
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application is a simple blog which allows a user to make new articles. Also uses local storage to load up articles faster. 

## Getting Started
1. Open the blog
2. Filter by Author or Category
3. Make a new blog post and use the JSON to store into data storage for future use

## Architecture
Tech: JS with ES6, HTML5, CSS3, Jquery3+
Description: Basic blog with filters for authors and categories and ability to create a new post. Also stores info locally after fetching from a remote server (currently a JSON file). It runs on our own server at this point.
